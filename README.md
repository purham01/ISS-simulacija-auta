# ISS-simulacija-auta
 
This project focuses on the development of a car driving simulation through urban and natural environments. The vehicle dynamically travels through a virtual space, allowing the user to control basic movements, including manipulating a manual gearbox and applying the handbrake for additional control during the driving simulation. The implementation includes support for both interior and exterior vehicle camera views. A significant feature of the project is the presence of traffic, meaning the autonomous movement of other vehicles not controlled by the user.
